<h2>Project 6: Data Visualizer (Matplotlib) </h2>
Tech: Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn<br>
What You Build: <br>Create visualizations (line charts, bar charts, scatter plots) from CSV data using Matplotlib with proper labels, legends, and titles.<br>
Exact Steps: <br>
1. Load a CSV dataset (sales, weather, etc.) <br>
2. Create line chart(e.g., revenue over time) <br>
3. Create bar chart (e.g., sales by region) <br>
4. Createscatter plot (e.g., price vs area) 5. Add proper titles, axis labels, legends 
<br>6. Color-code different categories <br>
7. Save visualization as PNG 
<br>8. Create a figurewith 2x2 subplots showing all types<br>
Learning Goals: <br>
- Matplotlib library usage <br>\
- Different chart types and when to use them <br>
- Data visualization best practices <br>
- Saving plots
 <h3>Problems that I faced</h3><br>
1. The problem with my sales data was as a begineer when I try to plot the graph it was ploting over for each indivisual stores so I need to plot over each store <br>
