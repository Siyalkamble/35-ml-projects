<h2>Project 4 Matrix Operations Calculator</h2>
What You Build: A NumPy program that creates 2D arrays (matrices), per-
forms operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose, and ma-
trix multiplication.<br>
Exact Steps:<br> 1. Create two 3x3 matrices using NumPy<br> 2. Matrix addition
(element-wise) <br>3. Matrix subtraction<br> 4. Scalar multiplication (multiply by single
number)<br> 5. Matrix multiplication (dot product)<br> 6. Transpose (flip rows and
columns)<br> 7. Calculate determinant <br>8. Visualize matrices as heatmaps using
Matplotlib<br>
Learning Goals: - NumPy arrays and operations - Linear algebra fundamen-
tals - Matrix math (critical for understanding neural networks later) - Visual-
ization of matrices<br>


<h3>Problems that i faced while making this mini project</h3>
1. I dont know how to take n-dimenstional array as a input but after some Dry Run I figured out the method 
2. At first I only remember that this is dot product and this is matrix addition, or this is the method to do scaler multiplication
I haven't truely understand what is happening under the hood so, <br>
First I understand the Math What is Happening Under the hood and them I implenment it in this Code
