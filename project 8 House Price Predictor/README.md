<h1>Project 8: House Price Predictor  </h1>
Tech: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib <br>
What You Build:<br> Load house price dataset, split into train/test, train linear regression model, make predictions, calculate accuracy (R² score), plot predictions vs actual prices.<br>
Exact Steps:<br>

1. Load Kaggle house price dataset 
2. Choose features (size, bedrooms, bathrooms, age) 
3. Split data: 80% train, 20% test 
4. Train Linear Regression model
5. Make predictions on test set V
6. Calculate R² score (how well model fits) 
7. Calculate Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
8. Plot: predicted prices vs actual prices 
9. Save trained model to file

Learning Goals:<br> - Machine learning workflow - Train/test split importance - Linear regression concept - Model evaluation metrics - Working with scikit learn<br>
Real-World Use: Real estate pricing, property valuation systems, market
analysis<br>
 <h2>Topic that I learned During this Project</h2>
 
 <h4> 1. What is One Hot Encoding</h4>
we Basically convert each feature into a vector like [1,0,0,0] -> for one column





<h2>Problems that I Faced</h2>

1. Not understanding the math behind ML, I knew that Math is crusial for ML, but by actually applying the Math I understand how ML actually use Math, I Use Math In Cost Function and Gradient descent, not theory but it's actual applications 
2. I need to know How to do enconding on Nominal catergory, I know that There are 2 types Nominal and ordinal. Ordinal means the value are like a ranking system greater the number better. But the Nominal works like Color or gender differnt but not one superior or like that 
3. So I need to do Nominal Encoding on this data, Specifically One-Hot-Encoding. since my object data-types are Nominal
