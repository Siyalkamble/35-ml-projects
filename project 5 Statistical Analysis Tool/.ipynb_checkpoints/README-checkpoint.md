<h2>Project 5 :- Statistical Analysis Tool Difficulty</h2>

What You Build:
<br>A statistics calculator using NumPy and Pandas that calculates mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and normalizes data using
z-score or min-max scaling.
<br>
Exact Steps: <br>
1. Load a dataset with numeric values <br>
2.  Calculate mean (average) <br>
3.  Calculate median (middle value) <br>
4.  Calculate mode (most frequentvalue) <br>
5.  Calculate standard deviation (spread of data)
6.  Normalize data using Z-score: (x - mean) / std <br>
7.  Normalize using Min-Max: (x - min) / (max - min)<br>
8.  Show before/after visualization<br>
Learning Goals:
<br>- Statistical calculations
<br>- Data normalization (CRITICAL
for ML)
<br>- Working with distributions
<br>- When to use which normalization
<br>
Real-World Use: Data science analysis, research, business metrics, preparing
data for ML
